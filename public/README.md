# Audio File Instructions

To use the firework sound from the YouTube video, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the audio from YouTube:**
   - Use a YouTube to MP3 converter (like yt-dlp, online converters, etc.)
   - Or use browser extensions that allow audio extraction
   - The YouTube URL is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqmiOoWBP0

2. **Convert to MP3 format:**
   - Ensure the file is in MP3 format
   - Recommended: Keep the file size reasonable (under 5MB for better loading)

3. **Place the file here:**
   - Rename the file to: `firework-sound.mp3`
   - Place it directly in this `public` folder
   - The final path should be: `public/firework-sound.mp3`

4. **Alternative formats:**
   - If you have the file in a different format (WAV, OGG, etc.), you can:
     - Update the file extension in `app/page.tsx` (search for `/firework-sound.mp3` and change to your format)
     - Or convert it to MP3 using an online converter

Once the file is in place, the firework sounds will automatically play when fireworks explode!
